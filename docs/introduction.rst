Introduction
============

Overview
--------

The Django Project Template is a comprehensive starting point for building web applications with Django. It provides a solid foundation with pre-configured components and best practices, allowing you to focus on building your application's unique features rather than setting up common functionality.

This template uses a custom user model with email-based authentication, which is a recommended approach for new Django projects as it provides more flexibility than the default username-based authentication.

Why Use This Template?
---------------------

Starting a new Django project from scratch requires setting up many common components:

* User authentication and authorization
* User profile management
* Password reset functionality
* Static files organization
* Base templates with responsive design
* Security configurations

This template provides all these components pre-configured and following best practices, saving you significant development time.

Key Advantages
-------------

1. **Email-based Authentication**: Uses email instead of username for authentication, which is more user-friendly and flexible.
2. **Ready-to-Use User Profiles**: Includes user profiles with customizable fields.
3. **Responsive Design**: Built with Bootstrap 5, providing a mobile-friendly interface out of the box.
4. **Security Best Practices**: Configured with security in mind, including password validation, CSRF protection, and more.
5. **Clean Organization**: Well-organized code structure following Django best practices.
6. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed documentation covering all aspects of the template.

Template Structure
-----------------

The template is organized into several Django apps and components:

* **accounts**: Custom user model and authentication functionality
* **website**: Basic website pages and functionality
* **templates**: HTML templates using Django's template system
* **static**: CSS, JavaScript, and image files

Each component is designed to be modular and easily customizable to fit your specific project needs.
