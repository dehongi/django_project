Introduction
===========

This Django template repository provides a solid foundation for new Django projects with a custom user model that uses email-based authentication instead of username. It's designed to save you time by providing commonly needed functionality out of the box.

.. note::
   This is a GitHub template repository, which means you can generate a new repository with the same directory structure and files without forking it or including the commit history.
