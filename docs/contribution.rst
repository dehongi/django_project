Types of Contributions
--------------------

There are many ways to contribute to the Django Project Template:

1. **Bug Reports**:
   
   - Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under Issues
   - If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one
   - Include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior

2. **Feature Requests**:
   
   - Suggest new features by opening an issue on GitHub
   - Clearly describe the feature and provide a use case
   - Explain why this feature would be useful to most users

3. **Documentation Improvements**:
   
   - Help improve or translate documentation
   - Fix typos or clarify existing content
   - Add examples or tutorials

4. **Code Contributions**:
   
   - Implement new features or fix bugs
   - Improve code quality, test coverage, or performance
   - Refactor existing code

Development Workflow
------------------

Here's the recommended workflow for code contributions:

1. **Create a branch**:
   
   .. code-block:: bash

       git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
       # or
       git checkout -b fix/issue-you-are-fixing

2. **Make your changes**:
   
   - Write clean, well-commented code
   - Follow the coding style guidelines
   - Include tests for new functionality or bug fixes
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Test your changes**:
   
   .. code-block:: bash

       # Run the test suite
       pytest
       
       # Check code quality
       flake8
       
       # Run type checking
       mypy .

4. **Commit your changes**:
   
   .. code-block:: bash

       git add .
       git commit -m "Description of the changes"

5. **Push to your fork**:
   
   .. code-block:: bash

       git push origin feature/your-feature-name

6. **Submit a pull request**:
   
   - Go to your fork on GitHub and click the "New pull request" button
   - Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution
   - Include the relevant issue number if applicable

Coding Standards
--------------

Please follow these guidelines when contributing code:

1. **Follow PEP 8**:
   
   - The Python style guide for code formatting
   - Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
   - Limit lines to 79 characters
   - Use meaningful variable and function names

2. **Write tests**:
   
   - All new features should come with tests
   - Bug fixes should include a test that would have caught the bug
   - Aim for high test coverage

3. **Document your code**:
   
   - Add docstrings to functions and classes
   - Include type hints where appropriate
   - Comment complex code sections

4. **Keep it simple**:
   
   - Follow Django's philosophy of "explicit is better than implicit"
   - Write simple, maintainable code
   - Avoid overengineering

Pull Request Guidelines
---------------------

A good pull request:

1. **Addresses a single concern**:
   
   - Focus on one feature or bug fix per PR
   - Keep changes minimal and focused

2. **Includes tests**:
   
   - New features should be covered by tests
   - Bug fixes should include regression tests

3. **Updates documentation**:
   
   - Add or update relevant documentation
   - Include docstrings for new functions and methods

4. **Passes CI checks**:
   
   - Code quality checks
   - Tests pass in all environments
   - Documentation builds successfully

5. **Follows branching conventions**:
   
   - feature/feature-name for new features
   - fix/issue-description for bug fixes
   - docs/documentation-improvement for documentation

Community Guidelines
------------------

To foster a welcoming and productive community:

1. **Be respectful**:
   
   - Treat all contributors with respect
   - Value different opinions and perspectives
   - Avoid dismissive or demeaning comments

2. **Help others**:
   
   - Answer questions in issues and discussions
   - Help review pull requests
